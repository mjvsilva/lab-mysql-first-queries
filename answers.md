7. Take a look on the data you retrieved in the question 5. Give some insights.
Four out of ten belong to the genre that is most rated and has the most apps: "Games". All of the "10 most rated apps" are free and feature a much higher rating count than the "10 best rated apps". Almost all of them (except for two) are available in multiple languages ("lang.num" column), which likely indicates that they have a large userbase. Most of them have advanced version numbers (only one of them is at version 1.x) which suggests that they are well established in the market. Given the large userbase, greater variation in the user ratings is to be expected.

8. Take a look on the data you retrieved in the question 6. Give some insights.
Six out of ten belong to the genre that is most rated and has the most apps: "Games". Almost all of the "10 best rated apps" are paid (except for one) and feature a generally lower rating count than the "10 most rated apps". One, in particular, has less than 10 ratings. Only two of them are available in more than 10 languages ("lang.num" column), which likely indicates that they have a smaller userbase. Given the fact that these are paid apps, it is possible that the quality standard during development is higher. The smaller userbase might also account for a lesser degree of variation in the user ratings. Both of these factors might contribute to the higher average ratings.

9. Now compare the data from questions 5 and 6. What do you see?
There is no intersection between the two sets of data, i.e. an app that is among both the "most rated" and the "best rated". Both sets reflect the tendency to have a higher percentage of "games" over other genres. The other genres in the "most rated apps" list are mostly related to "Social Networking" and entertainment ("Music", "Photo & Video"), while the "best rated" list features a different type of categories, with "Business" and "Education" included. The product rating ("cont_rating") is similar in both sets, as is the number of supported devices ("sup_devices.num", "ipadSc_urls.num"). The greatest differences between the two sets are in the "price" ("most rated" being free, and "best rated" being paid, generally) and in the rating count, which is much higher in the "most rated apps" list.


10. How could you take the top 3 regarding the user ratings but also the number of votes?
Head Soccer
Plants vs. Zombies
Sniper 3D Assassin: Shoot to Kill Gun Game


11. Do people care about the price?
The results indicate that they might, as free apps generally seem to have a significantly larger userbase (higher "rating_count_tot") than paid apps (19750 ratings of free apps vs. 4038 ratings of paid apps).
